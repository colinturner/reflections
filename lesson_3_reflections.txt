When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-You would create a remote repository when you want to A) Collaborate with others on a project,
B) Share your work publicly (e.g. promotional and/or open-source material), C) Keep a remote
copy of your work as a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-You want to pull changes manually because other collaborators will be uploading changes to
Git that you may not want to have on your local repo at any given time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
-Fork = GitHub-to-GitHub copy of someone's repository.
Clone = GitHub-to-Local or Local-to-Local copy of someone's repository.
Branch = A chain of commits.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
-The benefit is being able to run git diff and git status to see the difference between the last known GitHub version 
and your local version of a repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
