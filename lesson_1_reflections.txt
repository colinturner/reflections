How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
-Bash automatically scans the two texts to find the differences in them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-Pros of manual: you can choose good, logical save points.
-Cons of manual: you might forget to save often enough, or you might save too frequently.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Because in coding, many files are often related to one single project and they are interdependent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- You use git log to get the commit ID's. Then you use git diff with two ID's to 
see the difference between the two.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- You have the assurance of being able to retrieve older companies. You can always rewind time, thus
you can experiment without real risk.
